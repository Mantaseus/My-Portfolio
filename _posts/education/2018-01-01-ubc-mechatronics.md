### Summary
* Cultivated a deep understanding of Mechanical and Electrical systems and how they can be optimized to work together efficiently using controllers (such as proportional, PID, pole placement, discretized controllers, etc.)
* Proficient in the use of various programming languages and software tools.
* Good experience of working on diverse engineering projects individually and within teams through academic projects and coop work terms.

My education within this degree has allowed me to gain immense experience with various concepts related to Mechanical, Electrical, Software and Controls engineering. Through UBCs coop program I also gained vital real-world experience as I was able to work as a [field engineer]({% post_url coop/2015-01-01-bantrel-constructors %}), [semiconductors research intern]({% post_url coop/2016-09-01-robert-bosch-gmbh %}), and a [software development intern]({% post_url coop/2017-09-01-sytek %}). The [capstone project]({% post_url academic_projects/2017-04-01-flexoline-braiding-machine %}) also provided me with invaluable experience where we worked for real clients to solve their engineering needs.

### First Year - General Applied Science
At UBC, all the first year Engineering students take the same courses and build the same foundations in engineering. We were taught 
* Calculus
* Vector mathematics
* Concepts of Physics and Chemistry
* Solid Mechanics
* Kinematics
* C programming
* and much more.

### Second Year - Mechanical Engineering
Near the end of our first year, we were asked to choose the type of engineering that we wish to specialize in. I chose Mechanical Engineering because I had always been interested in robotics and automation. I felt that the best way to learn about robotics and automation would be to build a strong foundation in mechanical engineering and take Mechatronics in my third year to gain experience with electrical and software engineering concepts.

Going through the mechanical engineering program in my second year at UBC is arguably one of the toughest 8 months of my life. All the courses were tightly woven together to complement each other and had significant overlaps. We had midterm style "quizzes" every week, significant amount of homework and lab reports due every week, and had classes from 8am to 5pm everyday. I also had a considerable disadvantage of having to spend nearly 4 hours every day on commute while travelling from my home to UBC. However, in these 8 months, I was able to develop greatly as an individual and as an engineering and I learned how to be efficient with my time and with my working habits. 

We were taught in depth concepts of 
* Solid mechanics
* Kinematics
* Thermodynamics
* Fluid dynamics
* Vector calculus
* Differential equations
* Materials engineering

We also learned various important skills such as 3D modeling, drafting, soldering, and working in the machine shop.

I also got to work in two major projects with various other team members where we were given a limited amount of time to develop a device which satisfies various design requirements. The first project required us to make an autonomous car that can perform various maneuvers and navigate through a set of challenges on a raised path. The students were divided into various teams and were given only 2 weeks to finish a working autonomous car. At the end of the project, the teams competed against each other in various challenges that tested the versatility of our autonomous cars

In the second project we created a remote controlled boat in which we had to design the hull of the ship and the propeller. We worked in the same teams as in the first project and participated in a competition between teams at the end of the project

### Third Year - Mechatronics Option
For my third year, I was accepted as one of 28 other mechanical engineering students for the mechatronics option. I was very happy about getting accepted because this is what I had wanted to do from the start.

In this year, we took various mechatronics courses where we learned:
* Electrical and mechanical system modeling in time and frequency domains
* Operation of logic gates
* Programming FPGA boards (on an Altera DE2 board) using VHDL
* Programming an 8052 microcontroller using Assembly code
* Computer data structures and algorithms (recursion, stacks, queues, sorting, hashing, binary trees, etc.)
* Operation of motors (such as DC, induction, brushless DC and stepper motors)
* Advanced electrical circuit design and analysis using diodes, BJTs and MOSFETs. 

We also continued to develop our knowledge of:
* Solid mechanics
* Thermodynamics
* Data analysis and presentation techniques
* Mechanical part selection and tolerancing
* Operation and selection of various mechanical devices such as springs, gears, belts, roller chains, bearings, threaded fasteners, etc.

### Fourth Year - Mechatronics and Capstone
In my fourth year, all of my courses were entirely dedicated to mechatronics and the [capstone project]({% post_url academic_projects/2017-04-01-flexoline-braiding-machine %}). We learned various new concepts such as:
* Concurrent system design (parallel programming) and Real-Time programming
* Software modeling and planning using UML
* Basics of operation and usage of sensors and actuators (piezoelectric devices, LVDT, electrostatic actuators, temperature sensors, etc.)
* Interfacing between a microcontroller and a PC using a .NET C# program and microcontroller code written in C (using direct register manipulations)
* Controlling motors and reading analog data from sensors using embedded microcontrollers
* Designing continuous and discrete time control systems for mechanical and electrical devices such as PID, Lead-Lag, and Pole Placement controllers
* Stability analysis of continuous and discrete closed loop control systems
* Trajectory generation for computer controlled machines
* Practical implementation of mechatronics systems
* Engineering economics (taxes, depreciation, loans, financing, etc.)

### Fifth Year - Minor in Commerce
In order to diversify my skillset and increase my business knowledge, I decided to spend an extra semester at UBC and get a Minor in Commerce along with my engineering degree. I took various business related courses where I learned concepts of:
* Macroeconomics
* Microeconomics
* Effective marketing
* Organizational behavior
* Accounting
