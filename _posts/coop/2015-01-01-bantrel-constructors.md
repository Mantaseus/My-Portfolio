### About the Company
Bantrel Management Services Co. is a major provider of resource related construction management services within Canada. Bantrel is strongly affiliated with their parent company Bechtel Co., which is one of the biggest EPC (Engineering, Procurement and Construction) companies in the world.

Rio Tinto Alcan is a global leader of aluminum mining and production, and has one of their biggest aluminum smelters (used for extracting aluminum from alumina ore using high voltage electrolysis) in Kitimat, BC, Canada. In order to upgrade their aging infrastructure in Kitimat, Bechtel (and Bantrel by extension) was given a $3.3 Billion contract by Rio Tinto Alcan to oversee and manage the construction of their new aluminum smelter. This project was called the [Kitimat Modernization Project](http://www.bechtel.com/projects/kitimat-aluminum-smelter-modernization/).

### My Work
I joined Bantrel as an Assistant Field Engineer at peak workload near the end of the project in September 2014. I started out by managing inspection records and understanding the layout of the area I would be working in. By the end, I was given responsibility for organizing and keeping track of many documents, quality control records, inspection data, and daily/weekly quantity reporting. These documents were essential for system turnovers and commissioning which signifies the completion of work by Bantrel in a given area. To compile all of these documents I had to coordinate between people from various different trades such as ironworkers, millwrights, carpenters, electricians, etc., and keep track of when I can expect them to finish their work. I often had to work within tight schedules and deadlines to make sure that all the required documents were completed in an acceptable way. 

On this project I was also responsible for conducting extensive quality control inspections for various equipment as they were installed over the course of several weeks. So, I decided to create and develop various tools and systems that greatly improved the inspection process and made it much more streamlined for the inspector. I created a new organization and tracking system for these documents which allowed me to efficiently record and update their current status. I even went as far as to learn Visual Basic programming (Macros) in Microsoft Excel (over the course of a week or so) to automatically fill out the official documents based on my previous records using the proper formatting requirements. This allowed me to reduce the amount of time taken to fill out the numerous inspection documents from nearly 10 hours to only around an hour.

My supervisor had previously been responsible for all the work being done within the potrooms. The potrooms are the main area of the facility where 384 pots (48 pots in 8 separate areas) continuously smelt alumina ore into 99.9% pure aluminum. By the end of the four months, my supervisor ended up giving me nearly half of his responsibilities and I had overseen the installation and quality inspection of nearly 250 pots and other related installations in the potrooms.

In the last month of my work term, I even represented my supervisor in the weekly quantity meetings where all the Field engineers and Superintendents discussed the overall weekly progress of the project based on the quantities reported for each area.

### Conclusion
As an engineering student working on his first ever coop job as an engineer, I could not have hoped for a better job. My supervisor eased me into the job quickly and gave me significant responsibilities once he found that I could handle the challenge. Due to my heavy work load, I was able to gain valuable management experience and was also able to use my engineering and programing skills to improve the efficiency of the companyâ€™s inspection workflow.
