I created this website to showcase the depth and breadth of my current engineering experience so far in a compelling and easy to use way.

I also started working on this website to see if I could do it within 2 weeks. I had once tried to make Windows 8 apps using HTML5, CSS and Javascript back in 2013. But that was almost 5 years ago and I had never made a website before. So, I taught myself the basics of Jekyll (a static website generator) and tried to create a cohesive website from scratch that conforms to my vision and has a clean and minimalistic UI. I was able to learn the best practices for web design and how to design a website to be responsive to any given screen size (so that it automatically adapts to work seamlessly on desktops, tablets and mobile). I created all the assets and artwork using Photoshop and I also personally filmed and edited all the videos.

The feature image on this page and on the main page of the website represents the 4 key areas of my engineering experience: 
* Controls engineering
* Mechanical engineering
* Software development
* Electrical engineering 

In the end, I was able to finalize the basic design of the website in just 1 week, which far exceeded my initial predictions and shows how quickly I can learn new concepts and use them effectively in my projects.
