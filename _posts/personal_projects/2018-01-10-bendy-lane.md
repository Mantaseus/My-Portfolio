### About the Game
After finishing my education in December of 2017, I decided to try something different and test myself and see if I could make good quality android apps. I have previous experience in making android apps for personal use and for other [personal]({% post_url personal_projects/2015-06-01-elpis-smartwatch %}) and [academic]({% post_url academic_projects/2016-12-05-android-table-tennis %}) projects. However, I had never created a fully polished game before and had never published any apps to the app store. 

I started with a simple idea where the player needs to keep a car on a winding bendy road and keep their car's above 0% for as long as possible while the speed of the car increases. I worked on this game for a little more than a month and most of that time was spent in getting familiar with game development paradigms and software. I also had significant trouble in generating the smooth bendy road but I was able to achieve it by stitching together procedurally generated 2-point Bezier curves and significant help from the Godot Engine community. I hand drew all the art assets in the game using Photoshop and even gained some experience in artistic 3D modeling using Blender.

I spent some time in the beginning of the project to try out different game engines such as Unity, Godot, Unreal Engine, etc. After much deliberation, I decided on using the Godot Engine for Bendy Lane because it followed a programming paradigm that seemed better and more intuitive to me when compared with the other engines. Once the project was finished, I was very satisfied with the Godot engine as my first game engine even though it was relatively less popular than the other game engines.

By working on this project, I have gained useful experience in making games, publishing apps, and gain a better understanding of the work required to generate revenue from smartphone apps. I have always been excited by creating new things and now I have acquired new tools and skills that will allow me to work on even more interesting personal projects in the future.

If you have an Android phone then you can try out the game from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Kopfenheim.BendyLane)
